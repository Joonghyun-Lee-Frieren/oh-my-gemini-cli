name = "prd"
description = "Convert a request into PRD-quality scope, measurable acceptance criteria, and delivery constraints."
---

## Purpose

Use this skill to lock scope before implementation starts.

## Trigger

- Requirements are ambiguous or too broad
- Team needs measurable done criteria
- Scope creep risk is high

## Workflow

1. Write a concise problem statement.
2. Define in-scope and explicit non-goals.
3. Define acceptance criteria with evidence requirements.
4. Capture constraints and dependencies.
5. Produce handoff notes for execution and verification.

## Output Template

```markdown
## Problem Statement
- ...

## Scope / Non-goals
- ...

## Acceptance Criteria
| Criterion | Evidence Needed | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Constraints

## Handoff
