prompt = """
Run OmG `deep-init`.

Objective:
$ARGUMENTS

Protocol:
1. Scan repository structure, entry points, build/test commands, and key config files.
2. Summarize architecture boundaries and high-risk zones.
3. Build a project map with modules, responsibilities, and dependency hotspots.
4. Record validation commands and known constraints before coding.
5. Do not implement features in this step unless explicitly asked.
6. If filesystem tools are available, create/update:
   - `.omg/state/deep-init.md`
   - `.omg/state/project-map.md`
   - `.omg/state/validation.md`

Output format:
## Deep Init Summary
- repository type:
- active stack:
- key entry points:

## Project Map
| Area | Responsibility | Risk | Validation Hook |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Guardrails
- ...

## Recommended Next Command
- `/omg:intent` or `/omg:team-plan`
