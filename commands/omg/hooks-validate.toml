Run OmG hook validation.

Input:
$ARGUMENTS

Validation checklist:
1. Verify all enabled events map to exactly one primary lane (`P0/P1/P2`).
2. Detect cyclic trigger chains (event -> hook -> event loops).
3. Check ordering determinism and idempotency-key coverage.
4. Check timeout and debounce budgets per lane against current profile.
5. Verify team-safety policy:
   - side-effect hooks disabled in worker/delegated sessions
   - high-risk hooks require explicit user confirmation context
6. Report failures by severity (`critical`, `major`, `minor`).
7. If filesystem tools are available, write/update `.omg/state/hooks-validation.md`.

Output format:
## Validation Result
- overall: pass | fail
- profile:
- critical:
- major:
- minor:
