prompt = """
Run OmG `ultrawork` mode.

Objective:
$ARGUMENTS

Ultrawork protocol:
1. Decompose work into independent shards.
2. Group shards by risk and dependency.
3. Delegate fast implementation slices to `omg-executor`/`omg-quick`.
4. Run periodic verification gates with `omg-reviewer` every batch.
5. Keep a rollback-aware summary for each shard.

Rules:
- Do not merge unverified critical shards.
- Keep each shard bounded and reversible.
- Escalate cross-shard coupling risks.

Output format:
## Mode
- ultrawork

## Shard Plan
| Shard | Scope | Owner | Risk | Verify Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Throughput Log

## Quality Gate Summary
