Run OmG `autopilot` mode.

Objective:
$ARGUMENTS

Autopilot protocol:
1. Start with `team-plan` and `team-prd`.
2. Execute iterative cycles of `team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix`.
3. After each cycle, evaluate done criteria and blocker status.
4. Stop when all acceptance criteria pass, when blocked, or when max cycles are reached.
5. Default max cycles: 5 (override only if user explicitly requests).

State handling:
- If filesystem tools are available, update `.omg/state/workflow.md` and `.omg/state/checkpoint.md`.
- Include mode and cycle count in the state summary.

Output format:
## Mode
- autopilot
- max cycles:

## Cycle Board
| Cycle | Stage Result | Remaining TODO | Blockers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Completion Status
- done criteria:
- status:

## Next Action
- ...
