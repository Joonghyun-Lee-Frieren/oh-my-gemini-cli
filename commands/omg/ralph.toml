Run OmG `ralph` mode.

Objective:
$ARGUMENTS

Ralph protocol:
1. Enforce full staged pipeline: `team-plan -> team-prd -> team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix`.
2. Never skip `team-verify`.
3. If verify fails, run `team-fix` then return to `team-verify`.
4. Do not claim completion without pass evidence for all acceptance criteria.
5. Escalate unresolved blockers explicitly.

Mode posture:
- Planning/review depth first.
- Prefer conservative, reversible decisions.
- Keep final output release-oriented.

Output format:
## Mode
- ralph
